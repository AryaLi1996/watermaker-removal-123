# Cloud inpainting service

The learned filler that `backend/dewatermark.py` cannot afford to run locally.

## Why it is here

Undoing the blend recovers most of the picture arithmetically, on any machine,
in milliseconds. What is left is the few percent of pixels the mark covered
opaquely, and filling those with a diffusion inpainter leaves a trace that is
still legible: measured against the mark's own shape, 0.081 where the untouched
input reads 0.866 and a clean region reads 0.

A learned filler takes that to -0.001 +- 0.071 — indistinguishable from no mark
at all — without being any less faithful to the true picture (6.65 levels of
error against known frames, against 6.79 for the local filler). It costs about
a second a frame on four CPU cores, which is an hour for a two-minute clip, so
it does not belong on the user's machine.

## What crosses the network

The marked rectangle only. On the clip this was developed against that is
119x68 pixels of a 320x568 frame — the service never receives the rest of the
picture, and cannot reconstruct it. The mask is one image for the whole job.

    WebP q90, 2.7 KB a frame:  9.5 MB up and the same down for a 2-minute clip
    the whole video file, for comparison:  11.9 MB

## Running it locally

    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    FILL_SIGNING_SECRET=$(python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))') \
    LAMA_ONNX=/path/to/lama.onnx python -m uvicorn app:api --port 8000

The model is not vendored here: it is a 208 MB file, and where it lives is a
deployment decision. `Carve/LaMa-ONNX` on Hugging Face is the one these numbers
were measured with, and the deployed image bakes in that repository's
`lama_fp32.onnx` at a pinned commit with its checksum verified — see
`Dockerfile`.

Every route but `/health` wants a bearer token. Mint one for a local run with
the same function the licence service is specified to use:

    python3 -c "import auth, time; print(auth.sign({'app':'shuyin','sub':'me','exp':time.time()+3600}, '<the secret>'))"

The tests are the fast way to check a change:

    python -m unittest discover -p 'test_*.py' -v

None of them needs the model.

## Deploying it

`template.yaml` is the whole deployment: one Lambda, built from `Dockerfile`,
behind a Function URL. `scripts/deploy-inpaint.sh` applies it, and
`.github/workflows/deploy-inpaint.yml` is how it is meant to be applied —
test, then a change-set a reviewer reads, then an apply that reviewer released.
`CI_DEPLOY_SETUP.md` is the one-time AWS and GitHub setup that has to exist
first, and is the part nobody can do from a repository.

**A Lambda, not a GPU instance.** With no users yet, an always-on
`g4dn.xlarge` is about $380 a month to answer nothing, and this is $0. The
client's answer to an unreachable service is to fill locally and say so, so the
cheap option's failure mode is a slower, slightly more legible export rather
than a broken one. The next section is the cost of that choice, and how to
reverse it.

## How long a batch takes

Inference is about a second a frame on four CPU cores. The deployed Lambda runs
at 10240 MB, which buys roughly six, so a 240-frame batch is minutes rather
than the few seconds the same batch takes on a GPU.

That number is why `cloud_fill.REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` no longer exists. A
flat 120-second timeout would have abandoned every single batch this deployment
answered — a service that is up, working and being given up on, which from the
app's side is indistinguishable from one that is down. The client now budgets
per batch (`cloud_fill.timeout_for`), and bounds what a genuinely hung service
can cost by giving up on it for the rest of the export after one failure.

So on this deployment an export is *slow* and the picture is right. The
quality numbers above are the model's, and the model is the same one either
way; only the waiting differs.

**Moving to a GPU costs one environment variable**, on the licence service, and
nothing on any installed client: the app is handed the endpoint per export by
whatever just decided the export was allowed. See `METERING_ROUTES.md`. Do it
when people are waiting; there is nothing to prepare beforehand.

## What it is not

Accounting is not here, and should not be. The app already shares a licence
service, and that is where "who is entitled to what" is already answered —
`METERING_ROUTES.md` specifies the two routes it needs to grow. This service
checks a token that service minted (`auth.py`) and holds no account state at
all.

## Where it runs

AWS account `641628981129`, `us-east-1` — the same account as the licence
service, so what keeps this public endpoint away from the tables holding
licences and orders is IAM rather than an account boundary. The function's
execution role grants nothing but logs, which is the part that has to stay true
(`CI_DEPLOY_SETUP.md` §0). Which is a deployment detail everywhere except in
the app,
where it is the thing that decides what the user has to be told: for a user in
China, every export through this service is a cross-border transfer of personal
information, and PIPL article 39 asks for the overseas recipient by name, the
purpose and method, the categories, and how to exercise rights against that
recipient — with consent to that specifically, separately from anything else
they have agreed to. `renderer/src/cloud.ts` and `CloudConsentDialog.tsx` are
where that lives; moving the service into China would let both be shorter, and
moving it anywhere else changes neither.

The account number is recorded now, where it was deliberately left out before.
It is not a secret — it is a routing number, useless without credentials — and
`scripts/deploy-inpaint.sh` needs it to refuse a deployment aimed at the wrong
account, which is worth more than the small tidiness of leaving it out.

## Metering

The app asks before every export that would use this service, and tells it
afterwards what was used. Both routes live beside the licence ones on the
shared service (one base URL, dispatched by path suffix — see
`electron/license-config.js`), because who is entitled to what is a question
about an account, and that is where accounts already are.

**`POST fill/quota`** — may this export use the service?

    → { appId, deviceId, userId }
    ← { allowed:      true,
        limit:        100,              // included this period
        used:         12,
        remaining:    88,
        periodEnds:   "2026-10-01T00:00:00Z",
        overagePrice: "¥0.30",          // formatted by the service
        endpoint:     { url: "https://…/inpaint", token: "…" },
        reason:       null }            // a key the app has a sentence for,
                                        // when allowed is false

**`POST fill/consume`** — one export used it.

    → { appId, deviceId, userId, units }
    ← the same shape, with the new count

Two things about that shape are deliberate, and are the reason it is not three
constants in the app:

**Every number is the service's.** The allowance, the price beyond it, what
counts as one unit, when the period rolls over. Going from a hundred a month to
two hundred, changing the price, or charging per minute of video instead of per
export, is a change here and not a release everybody has to install. The app
renders what it is told and has no opinion.

**The endpoint comes back with the answer.** The app never holds a URL for this
service; it is given one per export, by the thing that just decided the export
was allowed. Turning the service off for everyone, or moving it, needs nothing
from the client.

The count is told after the fact rather than reserved before it, so what a user
is charged for is what they actually received: an export that fell back to the
local filler for every frame is not one of their hundred. And a service that
cannot be reached means the export is filled on the user's own machine — a
local count of something that costs money is a count that can be edited, and an
export that spends against a guess cannot be taken back.
