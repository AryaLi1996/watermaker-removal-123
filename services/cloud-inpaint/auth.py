"""
Who is allowed to spend GPU time here.

The service is reachable from anywhere — it is a Lambda Function URL, and an
unauthenticated one would be a stranger's inpainting service running on our
card. So every job carries a token, and this is the one place that decides
whether a token is good.

The token is *not* minted here. It is minted by the licence service, which is
the thing that already knows who has paid and how much of their allowance is
left, and it is handed to the app inside the same reply that says the export is
allowed (`fill/quota` → `endpoint: { url, token }`). This service only checks
it. That split is deliberate: entitlement is one question, asked in one place,
and this process holds no account state at all.

Shape, matching how the licence service already signs things (HMAC-SHA256 over
a compact payload, see its `handler.py`):

    <base64url(payload_json)>.<base64url(hmac_sha256(secret, base64url(payload_json)))>

    payload = { "app": "shuyin", "sub": "<stable user or device id>",
                "exp": <unix seconds> }

Signed over the *encoded* payload rather than the decoded one, so the two ends
never have to agree on how a dict serialises.

`sub` is carried so a log line can say which account spent the time, and is not
otherwise used: what an account is entitled to was already decided before the
token existed. `exp` is what keeps a leaked token from being worth anything for
long — the licence service issues them per export, minutes not months.
